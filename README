In order to setup a Clojure project with Maven 2, you need to follow these steps:

1) Get a copy of maven2 installed (http://maven.apache.org/)
On Ubuntu: apt-get install maven2

2) (Optional) Get the clojure-maven-plugin (http://github.com/talios/clojure-maven-plugin/tree/master)
run mvn install

The first project we have is a sample Swing application that renders a Mandelbrot set.

The second example is a simple web application based on the Servlet 2.5 specification, you can drop the resulting war on Tomcat to see the result. 

The second example uses clojure-json library (http://github.com/danlarkin/clojure-json/tree/master), you would have to install it into your maven repository by running:

  mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.clojure -DartifactId=clojure-json -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=clojure-json.jar

Hopefully, Both projects are fairly self explanatory and help you get started.
